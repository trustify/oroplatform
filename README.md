# The Oro Platform - Business Application Platform (BAP)

The Oro Platform offers developers the exact business application platform theyâ€™ve been looking for,
by combining the tools they need. Built in PHP5 and the Symfony2 framework, it seamlessly integrates
into [OroCRM](http://www.orocrm.com/) or works entirely standalone.
Developing custom business applications has never been so easy.
