UPGRADE FROM 1.8 to 1.9
=======================

####ActivityBundle
- Services with tag `oro_activity.activity_widget_provider` was marked as private

####ActivityListBundle
- The signature of `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Model\ActivityListProviderInterface::isApplicableTarget` method changed. Before: `isApplicableTarget(ConfigIdInterface $configId, ConfigManager $configManager)`. After: `isApplicableTarget($entityClass, $accessible = true)`. This can bring a `backward compatibility break` if you have own implementation of `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Model\ActivityListProviderInterface`.
- `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Entity\ActivityList::setEditor` deprecated since 1.8.0. Will be removed in 1.10.0. Use `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Entity\ActivityList::setUpdatedBy` instead.
- `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Entity\ActivityList::getEditor` deprecated since 1.8.0. Will be removed in 1.10.0. Use `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Entity\ActivityList::getUpdatedBy` instead.
- `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Model\ActivityListDateProviderInterface::getDate` removed. Use `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Model\ActivityListDateProviderInterface::getCreatedAt` and `Oro\Bundle\ActivityListBundle\Model\ActivityListDateProviderInterface::getUpdatedAt` instead

- The `Oro\Bundle\CommentBundle\Model\CommentProviderInterface` changed. The `hasComments` method removed. The `isCommentsEnabled` method added. The signature of the old method was `hasComments(ConfigManager $configManager, $entityName)`. The signature of the new method is `isCommentsEnabled($entityClass)`. This can bring a `backward compatibility break` if you have own implementation of `Oro\Bundle\CommentBundle\Model\CommentProviderInterface`.

####ConfigBundle
- An implementation of scope managers has been changed to be simpler and performant. This can bring a `backward compatibility break` if you have own scope managers. See [add_new_config_scope.md](./src/Oro/Bundle/ConfigBundle/Resources/doc/add_new_config_scope.md) and the next items for more detailed info.

        ... # some configuration
        source:
            acl_resource: 'acme_demo_entity_view'

```

Now

```
datagrid:
    acme-demo-grid:
        acl_resource: 'acme_demo_entity_view'
        ... # some configuration
```

- Option of datagrid "skip_acl_check" is deprecated, use option "skip_acl_apply" instead. Logic of this option was also changed. Before this option caused ignorance of option "acl_resource". Now it is responsible only for indication whether or not ACL should be applied to source query of the grid. See [advanced_grid_configuration.md](.src/Oro/Bundle/DataGridBundle/Resources/doc/backend/advanced_grid_configuration.md) for use cases. 

Before

```

```

will result

```
grid-name:
    source:
        value: 2
```

instead of

```
grid-name:
    source:
        value:
            - 1
            - 2
```

before:
```
    'fields' => [
        'firstName' => null,
        'lastName' => ['result_name' => 'surName']
    ],
    `post_serialize` => function (array &$item) {
        $item['fullName'] = $item['firstName'] . ' ' . $item['surName'];
    }
```
after:
```
    'fields' => [
        'firstName' => null,
        'lastName' => ['result_name' => 'surName']
    ],
    `post_serialize` => function (array $item) {
        $item['fullName'] = $item['firstName'] . ' ' . $item['lastName'];

After: `getRelatedEntityRulesAndBackendHeaders($entityName, $singleRelationDeepLevel, $multipleRelationDeepLevel, $field, $fieldHeader, $fieldOrder)`.
